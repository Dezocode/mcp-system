description: "Start the automated quality fix cycle for your codebase"
---

Start the MCP pipeline to automatically scan and fix quality issues in your codebase. The pipeline will identify problems, generate fix instructions, exit for you to apply them, then validate the changes.

This creates an iterative workflow:
1. Scan for issues
2. Generate specific fix instructions  
3. You apply the fixes
4. Pipeline validates changes
5. Repeat until all issues resolved

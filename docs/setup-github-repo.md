# 🚀 Step-by-Step GitHub Repository Setup

## The Issue
The repository `https://github.com/Dezocode/mcp-system.git` doesn't exist yet. You need to create it first on GitHub.com.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. **Open your browser** and go to: https://github.com/Dezocode

2. **Click the green "New" button** (or go to https://github.com/new)

3. **Fill in the repository details**:
   ```
   Repository name: mcp-system
   Description: 🚀 Universal MCP server management system with permissionless Claude Code CLI integration
   Visibility: ✅ Public
   Initialize this repository with: ❌ Leave ALL checkboxes UNCHECKED
   ```

4. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, you'll see a page with setup instructions. **Ignore those** and run:

```bash
cd /Users/dezmondhollins/mcp-system-complete
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: If You Get Authentication Issues

If you get a password prompt or authentication error, you have several options:

#### Option A: Use Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "MCP System Repository"
4. Check the "repo" scope (full repository access)
5. Copy the token
6. When prompted for password, paste the token instead

#### Option B: Use GitHub CLI (if available)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first
brew install gh  # macOS
# Then authenticate
gh auth login
# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

#### Option C: Use SSH (if you have SSH keys)
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Dezocode/mcp-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

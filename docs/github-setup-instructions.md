# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Create Repository on GitHub

Since the `gh` CLI is not available, you'll need to create the repository manually:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/Dezocode
2. **Click "New repository"** (green button)
3. **Repository details**:
   - **Repository name**: `mcp-system`
   - **Description**: `🚀 Universal MCP server management system with permissionless Claude Code CLI integration. Intelligent auto-discovery, modular upgrades, and production-ready deployment for all project types.`
   - **Visibility**: Public ✅
   - **Initialize repository**: ❌ Do NOT check any boxes (we already have files)
4. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Local Repository

Once you've created the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/dezmondhollins/mcp-system-complete

# Push to GitHub (you may need to authenticate)
git push -u origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, you may need to:

1. **Use Personal Access Token**: 
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token with `repo` permissions
   - Use token as password when prompted

2. **Or use SSH** (if you have SSH keys set up):
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Dezocode/mcp-system.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Upload

After pushing, check that all files are visible at:
**https://github.com/Dezocode/mcp-system**

You should see:
- ✅ README.md with project description
- ✅ All source files in `src/` directory
- ✅ Documentation in `docs/` directory  
- ✅ Docker and CI/CD configurations
- ✅ 40 files total uploaded

### Step 4: Create First Release

1. **Go to repository**: https://github.com/Dezocode/mcp-system
2. **Click "Releases"** (right sidebar)
3. **Click "Create a new release"**
4. **Release details**:
   - **Tag**: `v1.0.0`
   - **Title**: `MCP System v1.0.0 - Universal Server Management`
   - **Description**:
```markdown

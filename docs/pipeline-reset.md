description: "Clear pipeline state and start a fresh quality fix cycle"
---

Clear the MCP pipeline state and start completely fresh. This removes all cached data and begins a new analysis from scratch.

Use this when:
- Pipeline gets stuck or confused
- After major code changes
- To start fresh analysis
- After manually fixing issues outside the pipeline

The reset will clear all state files and begin a new scan.

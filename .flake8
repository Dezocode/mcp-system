# Extend ignore to preserve default ignore list while adding W503
extend-ignore = W503

# W503 line break before binary operator (contradicts W504 and modern PEP 8)
# This is disabled because:
# 1. Black formatter prefers line breaks before binary operators
# 2. PEP 8 updated in 2016 to recommend this style  
# 3. W503 and W504 are mutually exclusive - can't satisfy both
# 4. Modern Python tooling (Black, etc.) follows W503 style

# Set line length to 88 (Black's default, more permissive than PEP 8's 79)
max-line-length = 88

# Additional settings for consistency

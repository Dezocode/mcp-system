| Topic | Use Instructions (Verbose) | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Overview** | Consult this first to get a high-level understanding of what the Model Control Protocol (MCP) is, its core concepts, and the problems it aims to solve. Ideal for new team members or for a conceptual refresher. | [Link](https://docs.anthropic.com/mcp/overview) |
| **Architecture** | Read this to understand the fundamental components of the MCP system, such as the client, server, and transport layers. Essential for anyone designing or debugging the overall system structure. | [Link](https://docs.anthropic.com/mcp/architecture) |
| **Protocol Reference** | Use this as a detailed technical reference for the MCP message formats, data types, and request/response schemas. This is a critical resource for implementing or debugging the raw communication between client and server. | [Link](https://docs.anthropic.com/mcp/protocol-reference) |
| **API Reference** | Your primary resource for development. Look up specific functions, classes, methods, and their parameters when writing MCP-compliant Python code. Use this daily during implementation. | [Link](https://docs.anthropic.com/mcp/api-reference) |
| **Getting Started Guide** | Follow this guide for setting up your initial development environment, installing the necessary libraries, and running your first basic MCP server. The best starting point for hands-on development. | [Link](https://docs.anthropic.com/mcp/guides/getting-started) |
| **Extending with LLMs Guide** | Consult this guide when you need to integrate a new Large Language Model with the MCP system. It covers the required interfaces and best practices for making an LLM available as a tool. | [Link](https://docs.anthropic.com/mcp/guides/extending-llms) |
| **Building Extensions Guide** | Read this when you want to create new tools or capabilities for the MCP server. It explains the extension architecture and how to package and register new functionalities. | [Link](https://docs.anthropic.com/mcp/guides/building-extensions) |
| **Model Context Protocol Guide** | A deep dive into the core protocol itself. Use this to understand the philosophy behind MCP and the specifics of how context is managed, which is crucial for advanced development and optimization. | [Link](https://docs.anthropic.com/mcp/guides/model-context-protocol) |

# Enhanced Direct Pipeline Instructions - Task: environment_detection

## Direct Mode Execution Context
**Task**: environment_detection
**Context**: Direct execution mode
**Mode**: Direct execution with protocol integration
**Session**: direct-1756086929

## Real-time Guidance
1. **Direct Execution**: Bypass orchestrator for maximum speed
2. **Protocol Communication**: Use bidirectional protocol for feedback
3. **Performance Focus**: Monitor execution time and optimize
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Report results in real-time
5. **Adaptive Strategy**: Adjust approach based on immediate results

## Success Criteria
- Task completed with minimal execution time
- No regression in existing functionality
- Protocol communication maintained
- Performance metrics recorded

## Emergency Procedures
If direct execution fails:
1. Switch to protocol-guided mode
2. Enable detailed logging
3. Report failure context to orchestrator
4. Attempt recovery with safety checks

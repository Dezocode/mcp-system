# CI/CD Implementation Plan for `mcp-system-complete`

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) strategy for the `mcp-system-complete` project, leveraging GitHub Actions. The goal is to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application, ensuring code quality, rapid feedback, and reliable releases.

## 2. Goals of CI/CD for this Project

*   **Automated Testing:** Automatically run tests on every code change to catch bugs early.
*   **Code Quality Enforcement:** Integrate linting and code style checks to maintain a consistent codebase.
*   **Faster Feedback Loop:** Provide immediate feedback to developers on the health of their code changes.
*   **Reliable Releases:** Ensure that only tested and validated code is deployed.
*   **Streamlined Deployment:** Automate the process of deploying the application to target environments.
*   **Security:** Securely manage sensitive credentials and prevent their exposure.

## 3. Key Tools

*   **GitHub Actions:** The primary automation platform for defining CI/CD workflows.
*   **Python:** The primary language for the project.
*   **`pip`:** For managing Python dependencies.
*   **`flake8`:** For linting and enforcing code style (indicated by `.flake8` config).
*   **`pytest` (Assumed):** For running unit and integration tests. (Verification needed for actual test runner).
*   **Docker:** For containerizing the application (indicated by `Dockerfile`).

## 4. Workflow Overview

The CI/CD pipeline will generally follow these stages:

1.  **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    *   Triggered on every `push` to the `main` branch and on every `pull_request`.
    *   Checks out the code.
    *   Sets up the Python environment.
    *   Installs project dependencies.
    *   Runs linting checks.
    *   Executes all automated tests.
    *   If all steps pass, the CI is successful.

2.  **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):**
    *   Triggered upon a successful CI build on the `main` branch (or a specific release tag).
    *   Authenticates with necessary external services (e.g., Docker registry, deployment target).
    *   Builds the Docker image (if applicable).
    *   Pushes the Docker image to a container registry.
    *   Deploys the application to the target environment.

## 5. Detailed Workflow Steps (GitHub Actions)

We will define these workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory within your repository.

### 5.1. Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

This workflow will focus on validating code changes.

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master # Include if you use master branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - master # Include if you use master branch

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Or a more specific runner if needed

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.x' # Specify your exact Python version, e.g., '3.9', '3.10'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        # Install flake8 and pytest if not in requirements.txt, or ensure they are
        pip install flake8 pytest # Add other testing/linting tools here if needed

    - name: Run Linting (Flake8)
      run: |
        flake8 . --config=.flake8 # Assumes .flake8 is in the root

    - name: Run Tests (Pytest)
      run: |
        # IMPORTANT: Verify the correct command to run your tests.
        # This assumes pytest is configured to find tests automatically.
        pytest

    # Optional: Build a distributable package if your project is a library
    # - name: Build Python package
    #   run: |
    #     python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel # If you have a setup.py
```

**Verification Needed:**
*   Confirm the exact Python version used by your project.
*   Confirm the command to run your tests. If `pytest` is not used, replace `pytest` with the correct command (e.g., `python -m unittest discover`).

### 5.2. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) Workflow (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`)

This workflow will handle building and deploying the application. This part is highly dependent on your deployment target. Below is a general example for Docker-based deployment, which seems plausible given your `Dockerfile`.

```yaml
name: CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    # Only run CD if CI passes
    # workflow_run:
    #   workflows: ["CI Pipeline"]
    #   types:
    #     - completed
    #   branches:
    #     - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-and-test # Ensures CI passes before CD starts
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' # Only deploy from main branch

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # --- Docker Image Build and Push (Example) ---
    # If you deploy via Docker, this section is relevant.
    # Replace with your actual Docker registry and image names.
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

    - name: Log in to Docker Registry
      uses: docker/login-action@v3
      with:
        registry: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL }} # e.g., docker.io, ghcr.io
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Build and push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
      with:
        context: .
        push: true
        tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL }}/mcp-system-complete:latest # Adjust image name and tag
        # Add more tags for versioning, e.g., ${{ github.sha }}

    # --- Deployment to Target Environment (Example) ---
    # This section will vary greatly based on your deployment environment.
    # Examples: SSH, Kubernetes, Cloud Provider specific tools (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, gcloud)

    - name: Deploy to Staging/Production
      # This is a placeholder. You will need to replace this with your actual deployment logic.
      # Examples:
      # - Run an SSH command to pull the latest Docker image and restart the service.
      # - Apply Kubernetes manifests.
      # - Use a cloud provider's deployment tool.
      # - Execute one of your existing deployment scripts (e.g., run-pipeline, run-direct-pipeline)
      #   Ensure these scripts are designed to be non-interactive and can accept environment variables/secrets.
      run: |
        echo "Starting deployment..."
        # Example: If deploying to a server via SSH
        # ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@your-server.com "cd /path/to/app && docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d"

        # Example: If using your existing scripts (ensure they are safe for automation)
        # python run-pipeline # Or ./run-direct-pipeline
        # Consider passing secrets as environment variables to these scripts if needed
        # export LLM_API_KEY=${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
        # python your_deployment_script.py

      env:
        # Pass necessary secrets as environment variables to your deployment step
        LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
        JWT_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.JWT_SECRET_KEY }}
        DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
        REDIS_URL: ${{ secrets.REDIS_URL }}
        # ... any other secrets your deployment script needs
```

**Important Considerations for CD:**
*   **Deployment Strategy:** Define your deployment strategy (e.g., blue/green, canary, rolling updates).
*   **Environment Variables:** Ensure all necessary environment variables (especially secrets) are passed securely to your deployment environment.
*   **Rollback Plan:** Always have a plan for rolling back to a previous stable version in case of issues.
*   **Existing Scripts:** If you plan to use `run-pipeline` or `run-direct-pipeline`, ensure they are idempotent and can be run non-interactively in an automated environment. They should also be able to consume secrets via environment variables.

## 6. GitHub Secrets Configuration

All sensitive information identified in `.env.example` (and any other secrets) should be stored as GitHub Secrets.

**Steps to Configure GitHub Secrets:**

1.  Go to your GitHub repository.
2.  Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3.  Click on **New repository secret**.
4.  For each secret (e.g., `LLM_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`), enter the `Name` and `Value`.

**Example Secrets to Add:**

*   `LLM_API_KEY`
*   `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
*   `DATABASE_URL`
*   `REDIS_URL`
*   `DOCKER_USERNAME` (if pushing to a private Docker registry)
*   `DOCKER_PASSWORD` (if pushing to a private Docker registry)
*   `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL` (e.g., `docker.io` for Docker Hub, `ghcr.io` for GitHub Container Registry)
*   Any other credentials required for your specific deployment target (e.g., cloud provider credentials).

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

After implementing CI/CD, it's crucial to monitor your pipelines and deployed applications:

*   **GitHub Actions Logs:** Review the logs of your GitHub Actions runs for any failures or unexpected behavior.
*   **Application Logs:** Ensure your deployed application logs are accessible for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Metrics:** Integrate monitoring tools (like Prometheus, as indicated in `.env.example`) to track application performance and health.

## 8. Future Enhancements

Once a basic CI/CD pipeline is established, consider these enhancements:

*   **Staging Environments:** Deploy to a staging environment before production for final testing.
*   **Automated Release Tagging:** Automatically create Git tags for successful deployments.
*   **Semantic Versioning:** Implement semantic versioning for your releases.
*   **Code Coverage Reports:** Integrate tools to generate and track code coverage.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Add steps for security scanning (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk, Trivy for Docker images).
*   **Notifications:** Set up notifications for pipeline failures (e.g., Slack, email).
*   **Rollback Automation:** Automate the process of rolling back to a previous stable deployment.

## 9. Action Plan for Implementation

1.  **Verify Test Command:** Determine the exact command to run your project's tests (e.g., `pytest`, `python -m unittest discover`).
2.  **Create `.github/workflows/` Directory:** Create this directory in your project root.
3.  **Create `ci.yml`:** Copy the CI workflow content into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
4.  **Create `cd.yml`:** Copy the CD workflow content into `.github/workflows/cd.yml`.
5.  **Configure GitHub Secrets:** Add all necessary secrets to your GitHub repository settings.
6.  **Customize CD Workflow:** Adapt the CD workflow's deployment step to your specific deployment target and strategy. Ensure any existing deployment scripts (`run-pipeline`, `run-direct-pipeline`) are suitable for automation.
7.  **Test Workflows:** Push changes to a test branch or create a pull request to trigger the CI workflow. Once CI is stable, test the CD workflow.
8.  **Iterate and Refine:** Continuously monitor and improve your CI/CD pipelines based on feedback and evolving project needs.

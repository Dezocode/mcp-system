## üö´ Features NOT Implemented (By Design)

### 1. Deep Semantic Analysis
**Reason**: Requires sophisticated AI/ML capabilities beyond current scope
**Examples**: Intent vs implementation validation, business logic errors
**Alternative**: Focus on syntactic and structural analysis

### 2. Runtime Behavior Prediction  
**Reason**: Requires complex static analysis infrastructure
**Examples**: Performance bottleneck prediction, resource leak detection
**Alternative**: Pattern-based security and structure analysis

### 3. Machine Learning Pattern Recognition
**Reason**: Would require training data and ML infrastructure
**Examples**: Codebase-specific pattern learning, adaptive suggestions
**Alternative**: Rule-based pattern recognition with high accuracy

### 4. Cross-Platform Integration Analysis
**Reason**: Would require extensive platform-specific knowledge bases
**Examples**: OS-specific API compatibility, environment dependencies
**Alternative**: Basic pattern detection for common issues

## üéØ Remaining Issues for Full Self-Healing Capabilities

### Phase 2: Advanced Correlation & Validation

#### 1. Enhanced Issue Correlation System
**Current Gap**: Issues are analyzed independently
**Needed**: Link related issues for cascading fixes
```python
# Example: Import fix enables undefined function resolution
import_fix -> undefined_function_resolution -> duplicate_consolidation
```

#### 2. Multi-Level Validation System
**Current Gap**: Basic syntax validation only
**Needed**: Execution safety, semantic consistency, integration testing
```python
validation_levels = [
    "syntax_validation",      # ‚úÖ Implemented
    "import_validation",      # ‚úÖ Basic implementation  
    "execution_safety",       # ‚ùå Needed
    "semantic_consistency",   # ‚ùå Needed
    "integration_testing"     # ‚ùå Needed
]
```

#### 3. Self-Healing Watchdog Integration
**Current Gap**: Manual execution only
**Needed**: Continuous monitoring and automatic triggering
```python
# Real-time file watching with intelligent triggering
watchdog_features = [
    "file_change_detection",     # ‚ùå Needed
    "intelligent_batching",      # ‚ùå Needed  
    "conflict_resolution",       # ‚ùå Needed
    "automatic_recovery"         # ‚ùå Needed
]
```

### Phase 3: Production Hardening

#### 1. Advanced Error Recovery
**Current Gap**: Basic rollback on syntax errors
**Needed**: Comprehensive recovery strategies
```python
recovery_capabilities = [
    "partial_fix_rollback",      # ‚ùå Needed
    "dependency_chain_recovery", # ‚ùå Needed
    "cross_file_consistency",    # ‚ùå Needed
    "state_restoration"          # ‚ùå Needed
]
```

#### 2. Integration Testing Framework
**Current Gap**: No automated validation of fixes
**Needed**: Comprehensive test execution and validation
```python
testing_framework = [
    "pre_fix_testing",           # ‚ùå Needed
    "post_fix_validation",       # ‚ùå Needed
    "regression_detection",      # ‚ùå Needed
    "performance_impact_analysis" # ‚ùå Needed
]
```

#### 3. Version Control Integration
**Current Gap**: File-level operations only
**Needed**: Git-aware operations with branch management
```python
vcs_integration = [
    "branch_creation",           # ‚ùå Needed
    "commit_strategies",         # ‚ùå Needed

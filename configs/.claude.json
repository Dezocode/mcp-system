It serves as a practical template for creating your own MCP servers, simply using Mem0 and a practical example.\n\nThe implementation follows the best practices laid out by Anthropic for building MCP servers, allowing seamless integration with any MCP-compatible client.\n\nFeatures\nThe server provides three essential memory management tools:\n\nsave_memory: Store any information in long-term memory with semantic indexing\nget_all_memories: Retrieve all stored memories for comprehensive context\nsearch_memories: Find relevant memories using semantic search\nPrerequisites\nPython 3.12+\nSupabase or any PostgreSQL database (for vector storage of memories)\nAPI keys for your chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Ollama)\nDocker if running the MCP server as a container (recommended)\nInstallation\nUsing uv\nInstall uv if you don't have it:\n\npip install uv\nClone this repository:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-mem0.git\ncd mcp-mem0\nInstall dependencies:\n\nuv pip install -e .\nCreate a .env file based on .env.example:\n\ncp .env.example .env\nConfigure your environment variables in the .env file (see Configuration section)\n\nUsing Docker (Recommended)\nBuild the Docker image:\n\ndocker build -t mcp/mem0 --build-arg PORT=8050 .\nCreate a .env file based on .env.example and configure your environment variables\n\nConfiguration\nThe following environment variables can be configured in your .env file:\n\nVariable    Description    Example\nTRANSPORT    Transport protocol (sse or stdio)    sse\nHOST    Host to bind to when using SSE transport    0.0.0.0\nPORT    Port to listen on when using SSE transport    8050\nLLM_PROVIDER    LLM provider (openai, openrouter, or ollama)    openai\nLLM_BASE_URL    Base URL for the LLM API    https://api.openai.com/v1\nLLM_API_KEY    API key for the LLM provider    sk-...\nLLM_CHOICE    LLM model to use    gpt-4o-mini\nEMBEDDING_MODEL_CHOICE    Embedding model to use    text-embedding-3-small\nDATABASE_URL    PostgreSQL connection string    postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db\nRunning the Server\nUsing uv\nSSE Transport\n# Set TRANSPORT=sse in .env then:\nuv run src/main.py\nThe MCP server will essentially be run as an API endpoint that you can then connect to with config shown below.\n\nStdio Transport\nWith stdio, the MCP client iself can spin up the MCP server, so nothing to run at this point.\n\nUsing Docker\nSSE Transport\ndocker run --env-file .env -p:8050:8050 mcp/mem0\nThe MCP server will essentially be run as an API endpoint within the container that you can then connect to with config shown below.\n\nStdio Transport\nWith stdio, the MCP client iself can spin up the MCP server container, so nothing to run at this point.\n\nIntegration with MCP Clients\nSSE Configuration\nOnce you have the server running with SSE transport, you can connect to it using this configuration:\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mem0\": {\n      \"transport\": \"sse\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:8050/sse\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nNote for Windsurf users: Use serverUrl instead of url in your configuration:\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mem0\": {\n      \"transport\": \"sse\",\n      \"serverUrl\": \"http://localhost:8050/sse\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nNote for n8n users: Use host.docker.internal instead of localhost since n8n has to reach outside of it's own container to the host machine:\n\nSo the full URL in the MCP node would be: http://host.docker.internal:8050/sse\n\nMake sure to update the port if you are using a value other than the default 8050.\n\nPython with Stdio Configuration\nAdd this server to your MCP configuration for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or any other MCP client:\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mem0\": {\n      \"command\": \"your/path/to/mcp-mem0/.venv/Scripts/python.exe\",\n      \"args\": [\"your/path/to/mcp-mem0/src/main.py\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"TRANSPORT\": \"stdio\",\n        \"LLM_PROVIDER\": \"openai\",\n        \"LLM_BASE_URL\": \"https://api.openai.com/v1\",\n        \"LLM_API_KEY\": \"YOUR-API-KEY\",\n        \"LLM_CHOICE\": \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n        \"EMBEDDING_MODEL_CHOICE\": \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n        \"DATABASE_URL\": \"YOUR-DATABASE-URL\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nDocker with Stdio Configuration\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mem0\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\"run\", \"--rm\", \"-i\", \n               \"-e\", \"TRANSPORT\", \n               \"-e\", \"LLM_PROVIDER\", \n               \"-e\",

             \"mcp/mem0\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"TRANSPORT\": \"stdio\",\n        \"LLM_PROVIDER\": \"openai\",\n        \"LLM_BASE_URL\": \"https://api.openai.com/v1\",\n        \"LLM_API_KEY\": \"YOUR-API-KEY\",\n        \"LLM_CHOICE\": \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n        \"EMBEDDING_MODEL_CHOICE\": \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n        \"DATABASE_URL\": \"YOUR-DATABASE-URL\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nBuilding Your Own Server\nThis template provides a foundation for building more complex MCP servers. To build your own:\n\nAdd your own tools by creating methods with the @mcp.tool() decorator\nCreate your own lifespan function to add your own dependencies (clients, database connections, etc.)\nModify the utils.py file for any helper functions you need for your MCP server\nFeel free to add prompts and resources as well with @mcp.resource() and @mcp.prompt()\nAbout\nMCP server for long term agent memory with Mem0. Also useful as a template to get you started building your own MCP server with Python!\n\nResources\n Readme\nLicense\n MIT license\n Activity\nStars\n 514 stars\nWatchers\n 8 watching\nForks\n 205 forks\nReport repository\nReleases\nNo releases published\nPackages\nNo packages published\nLanguages\nPython\n96.8%\n \nDockerfile\n3.2%\nFooter\n© 2025 GitHub, Inc.\nFooter navigation\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nDocs\nContact\nManage cookies\nDo not share my personal information\nCopied!

This SDK will be the source of the AI's commands.\n\nSDK Event Handling: The SDK will likely provide events (e.g., when the AI decides on an action). Your main.js code will listen for these events.\n\nIPC Main -> Renderer: When your main.js code receives an action event from the SDK, it will forward the command to the renderer using the same ai-cursor-command IPC channel as before.\n\nRenderer Execution: The renderer code remains unchanged. It still listens for ai-cursor-command and handles the visual cursor animation and typing simulation within the <webview>.\n\n## The Code: SDK Integration\nYou only need to change main.js. The files preload.js, renderer/app.js, index.html, and your CSS file with the #ai-cursor style are all correct and do not need any modifications.\n\nmain.js - Replace the Server with the SDK\nWe will remove the http server and create a new function to initialize the Claude SDK.\n\nNote: Since I don't have access to the specific Claude Code SDK, I'm providing a realistic example based on how modern SDKs typically work. You will need to adjust the package name and method calls to match the SDK's actual documentation.\n\nJavaScript\n\n// In main.js\n\n// Remove or comment out the 'http' requirement\n// const http = require('http');\n\n// ** NEW: Hypothetical Claude Code SDK Integration **\n// You will need to install the actual SDK, e.g., via 'npm install @claude/code-sdk'\n// and adjust the name here.\nconst { ClaudeSDK } = require('@claude/code-sdk'); // This is a placeholder name\n\n/**\n * Initializes the Claude SDK and sets up listeners for AI actions.\n * @param {SlitherChromeContainer} appInstance - The main instance of your application.\n */\nfunction setupClaudeSDK(appInstance) {\n    // 1. Instantiate the SDK with your credentials\n    const claude = new ClaudeSDK({\n        apiKey: process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY, // It's best practice to use environment variables\n        // ... other SDK-specific options\n    });\n\n    // 2. Set up a listener for when the AI wants to perform an action\n    claude.on('action', (action) => {\n        console.log('🤖 Received action from Claude SDK:', action);\n\n        // 3. Forward the action to the renderer for execution, just like before\n        if (appInstance.mainWindow && !appInstance.mainWindow.isDestroyed()) {\n            appInstance.mainWindow.webContents.send('ai-cursor-command', action);\n        }\n    });\n\n    // 4. Connect or start the SDK session\n    claude.connect().then(() => {\n        console.log('✅ Claude SDK connected and ready.');\n    }).catch(err => {\n        console.error('❌ Failed to connect Claude SDK:', err);\n    });\n}\n\n// Remove the entire 'setupAiServer' function from the previous step.\n\n// ... your existing SlitherChromeContainer class ...\n\nconst containerApp = new SlitherChromeContainer();\n\n// In the app.whenReady() block, call the new SDK setup function\napp.whenReady().then(async () => {\n    containerApp.setupIPC();\n    containerApp.setupTerminal();\n    await containerApp.createMainWindow();\n\n    // Start live metrics\n    containerApp.metricsInterval = setInterval(() => {\n        containerApp.updateRendererStatus();\n    }, 3000);\n\n    // ** CALL THE NEW SDK SETUP FUNCTION HERE **\n    setupClaudeSDK(containerApp);\n\n    console.log('🚀 Container app ready...');\n});\n## How It Works Now\nYour Electron app starts, and main.js initializes and connects the Claude SDK.\n\nThe AI, working through the SDK, decides to perform an action. For example, it might decide to \"click on the element at (x: 500, y: 250) and type 'const x = 10;'\".\n\nThe SDK emits an action event inside your main.js process with a payload like:\n\nJSON\n\n{\n  \"x\": 500,\n  \"y\": 250,\n  \"action\": \"type\",\n  \"text\": \"const x = 10;\"\n}\nYour claude.on('action', ...) listener catches this and sends it to the renderer.\n\nYour unchanged renderer/app.js code receives the command and performs the beautiful, highlighted cursor animation and simulated typing in the <webview>.\n\nThis approach is more integrated, secure, and robust, providing the exact native control you're looking for."

It looks like you've run into a classic race condition with Electron's <webview> tag.\n\nThe error Error: ERR_ABORTED (-3) loading 'about:blank' is the key clue. This error happens when a navigation or resource load inside a <webview> is suddenly cancelled. The most common cause is the parent window being reloaded while the webview is trying to initialize.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe issue is in your main.js file, within the createMainWindow function. You have these two lines:\n\nJavaScript\n\n// main.js - inside createMainWindow()\nthis.mainWindow.webContents.session.clearCache();\nthis.mainWindow.webContents.reloadIgnoringCache(); // <-- This is the problem\nWhile clearCache() is fine, the reloadIgnoringCache() call forces an immediate, hard refresh of your entire renderer window right after it loads. Your renderer code (app.js) is likely trying to set up the <webview> at the same time, and this reload aborts its initial navigation, causing the ERR_ABORTED crash.\n\n## The Fix: Remove the Aggressive Reload\nThe fix is straightforward: we just need to remove that aggressive reload. The clearCache() call is usually enough to prevent caching issues during development.\n\nOpen main.js.\n\nFind the createMainWindow method.\n\nComment out or delete the reloadIgnoringCache() line.\n\nHere’s how the corrected section of main.js should look:\n\nJavaScript\n\n// main.js\n\n    async createMainWindow() {\n        this.mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n            // ... webPreferences ...\n        });\n\n        await this.mainWindow.loadFile('renderer/index.html');\n        \n        // Clearing cache is fine, but we'll remove the disruptive reload.\n        this.mainWindow.webContents.session.clearCache();\n        // this.mainWindow.webContents.reloadIgnoringCache(); // COMMENT OUT OR DELETE THIS LINE\n\n        // Enable dev tools to debug preload issues\n        this.mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();\n\n        // ... rest of the function ...\n    }\n## Best Practice: Add Webview Error Listeners\nTo make your app more robust, it's a great idea to listen for errors directly on the <webview> element in your renderer code. This will help you catch and log any future issues with it.\n\nYou'll need to add this code to your renderer's JavaScript file (likely renderer/app.js), wherever you manage your webview element.\n\nJavaScript\n\n// renderer/app.js (or your equivalent renderer script)\n\n// Assuming you have a reference to your webview element\nconst devtoolsView = document.getElementById('devtools-view'); // Use your actual webview ID\n\nif (devtoolsView) {\n    // Listen for crashes in the webview's renderer process\n    devtoolsView.addEventListener('crashed', (event) => {\n        console.error('🔥 Webview has crashed!', event);\n        // Use the API we created in preload.js to report it\n        window.electronAPI.reportWebviewError({\n            source: 'WebView',\n            message: 'The DevTools webview process has crashed.'\n        });\n    });\n\n    // Listen for navigation failures\n    devtoolsView.addEventListener('did-fail-load', (event) => {\n        // We can ignore user-cancelled events, which have the code -3\n        if (event.errorCode === -3) {\n            console.warn('WebView navigation aborted, likely intentional.');\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        console.error('🔥 Webview failed to load:', event);\n        window.electronAPI.reportWebviewError({\n            source: 'WebView',\n            message: `Failed to load URL: ${event.validatedURL}. Error code: ${event.errorCode}`\n        });\n    });\n}\n## Next Steps\nApply the change to main.js.\n\n(Optional but recommended) Add the error listeners to your renderer's JavaScript.\n\nSave the files and restart the app using the terminal command:\n\nBash\n\nnpm run restart-dev\nThe ERR_ABORTED errors should now be gone! Let me know if anything else comes up."

# Qwen Code Pipeline Upgrade Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive pipeline upgrade plan for the MCP System, integrating automated quality checking, fixing, and GitHub integration. The system now includes a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with MCP server integration, JSON-structured data flow, and seamless Claude Code integration.

## System Architecture Overview

The upgraded pipeline consists of several interconnected components:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Pipeline** - 5-stage automated CI/CD pipeline
2. **Pipeline MCP Server** - Fully MCP v1.0 compliant server with 6 tools
3. **Enhanced Quality Tools** - Version Keeper and Quality Patcher with JSON output
4. **Session Management System** - Tracking and performance metrics
5. **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive validation suite

## GitHub Actions Workflow Pipeline

### Workflow Structure
File: `.github/workflows/pipeline-integration.yml`

The 5-stage pipeline provides automated quality management:
1. **Version Keeper Scan** - Comprehensive linting and issue detection
2. **Quality Patcher** - Automated fix application
3. **Version Keeper Validate** - Validation of applied fixes
4. **GitHub Integration** - Automatic staging and committing
5. **Cleanup** - Session management and reporting

### Key Features
- Automatic triggering on code changes to `src/`, `core/`, `scripts/`, and Python files
- Manual triggering with configurable parameters (`max_fixes`, `force_fresh_report`)
- Multi-stage pipeline with proper dependency management
- JSON output support for all pipeline components
- Automatic commit/stage functionality after successful fixes
- PR commenting with pipeline results
- Artifact management for reports and logs

## Pipeline MCP Server

### Server Implementation
File: `src/pipeline_mcp_server.py`

A fully compliant MCP server that exposes pipeline operations as tools, following Anthropic MCP v1.0 specification.

### Available Tools

1. **`version_keeper_scan`** - Run comprehensive linting scans
   - Supports session management and comprehensive linting
   - JSON output with detailed metrics
   - Configurable target files and output formats

2. **`quality_patcher_fix`** - Apply automated fixes
   - Configurable fix limits (1-50 fixes)
   - Claude agent integration for intelligent fixes
   - Auto-apply functionality for automation

3. **`pipeline_run_full`** - Execute complete pipeline cycles
   - Multi-cycle execution with quality score targeting
   - Configurable cycles (1-10) and fixes per cycle
   - Early termination on success conditions

4. **`github_workflow_trigger`** - Trigger GitHub Actions workflows
   - Customizable workflow parameters
   - Branch targeting and input configuration
   - Completion monitoring capabilities

5. **`pipeline_status`** - Monitor active pipeline sessions
   - Session-specific or global status reporting
   - Artifact and performance metrics tracking
   - Detailed session lifecycle information

6. **`mcp_compliance_check`** - Validate MCP server compliance
   - Tool and schema validation
   - Error handling compliance checking
   - Detailed compliance scoring

### Compliance Features
- ✅ Proper error handling with `McpError` and `ErrorCode`
- ✅ Complete `inputSchema` definitions for all tools
- ✅ Anthropic MCP v1.0 specification compliance
- ✅ Session management and state tracking
- ✅ Async/await patterns throughout

## Enhanced Quality Tools

### Version Keeper
File: `scripts/version_keeper.py`

Enhanced with JSON output support:
- `--output-format=json` option for structured reporting
- `--output-file` parameter for custom output paths
- Session directory management
- Comprehensive JSON reports with timestamps, session IDs, and detailed metrics

### Quality Patcher
File: `scripts/claude_quality_patcher.py`

Enhanced with automation features:
- `--auto-apply` flag for non-interactive fixes
- JSON output support with detailed fix reports
- Session-based reporting and tracking
- Performance metrics and success rate tracking

## Session Management System

### Session Structure
Each pipeline execution creates a session with:
- Unique session ID with timestamp
- Structured output directory
- Artifact preservation
- Performance metrics tracking
- Audit trail

### Directory Structure
```
pipeline-sessions/
└── session_20240821_120000/
    ├── lint-report.json
    ├── fixes-report.json
    ├── validation-report.json
    └── logs/
```

## Testing Framework

### Test Suite
File: `tests/test_pipeline_integration.py`

Comprehensive test suite validating:
1. Version Keeper JSON output functionality
2. Quality Patcher JSON output functionality
3. Pipeline MCP server functionality
4. GitHub workflow syntax validation
5. MCP compliance checking

### Simple Test Scripts
- `scripts/simple_version_keeper.py` - Minimal test version
- `scripts/simple_quality_patcher.py` - Minimal test version

## Configuration

### MCP Server Configuration
File: `.mcp-server-config.json`

- Proper command and argument setup
- Environment variable configuration
- Security settings with allowed/restricted paths
- Session management parameters
- Tool capabilities definition

## Integration Benefits

### Automated Quality Management
- Zero-configuration operation out of the box
- Intelligent Claude-powered automated repairs

### Developer Productivity
- No manual intervention required for common fixes
- Real-time feedback through PR comments
- Complete audit trail with session tracking

### CI/CD Integration
- Pipeline automation triggering on code changes
- Artifact management with downloadable reports
- Branch protection through quality gates

### Claude Code Integration

- 6 powerful tools in Claude's ecosystem
- Session persistence for context across operations

## Usage Examples

### Local Pipeline Execution via MCP
```bash
# Start the Pipeline MCP Server
python3 src/pipeline_mcp_server.py

# Use with Claude or MCP clients to:
# - Run version keeper scans
# - Apply quality fixes
# - Execute full pipeline cycles
# - Monitor pipeline status
```

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# Trigger automatically on code changes
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop, version-0.2 ]
    paths: [ 'src/**', 'scripts/**', '*.py' ]

# Or manually with custom parameters
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    max_fixes: '10'
    force_fresh_report: 'true'
```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Version Keeper with JSON output
python3 scripts/version_keeper.py \
  --lint-only \
  --comprehensive-lint \
  --output-format=json \
  --output-file=reports/lint-report.json

# Quality Patcher with auto-apply
python3 scripts/claude_quality_patcher.py \
  --max-fixes=10 \
  --auto-apply \
  --output-format=json \
  --output-file=reports/fixes-report.json
```

## Implementation Validation

### Critical Fixes Applied
1. **GitHub Actions References** - Fixed snapshot paths to proper action versions
2. **Hardcoded Paths** - Replaced with relative paths for portability

### Testing Results
All components have been validated with comprehensive tests:
- ✅ Version Keeper JSON output working
- ✅ Quality Patcher JSON output working
- ✅ Pipeline MCP Server functional
- ✅ GitHub workflow syntax valid
- ✅ MCP compliance validated

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

# Trigger GitHub Actions (requires repo setup)
gh workflow run pipeline-integration.yml --ref version-0.2
```

## Conclusion

The enhanced pipeline integration provides a robust foundation for automated quality management and CI/CD pipeline integration, with native Claude Code support through the MCP protocol. All critical issues identified during development have been resolved, and the system is ready for production use.

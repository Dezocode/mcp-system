# Gemini Pipeline Plan

This document outlines my plan for acting as the agent to drive the `run-pipeline-claude-interactive` script and resolve all identified code quality issues.

My role is to iteratively execute the pipeline, analyze the generated instructions, and apply the necessary code fixes until the codebase is clean.

## My Workflow

1.  **Execute Pipeline:** I will start by running `./run-pipeline-claude-interactive`.
2.  **Analyze Instructions:** I will read the output and the generated instruction files (`docs/.claude-instructions.md` and `sessions/.claude-fixes.json`) to understand the required fixes.
3.  **Apply Fixes:** I will use my code editing tools to directly fix the issues in the specified files. I will prioritize critical errors like syntax and indentation issues first.
4.  **Re-run and Validate:** After applying a batch of fixes, I will re-run `./run-pipeline-claude-interactive` to validate my changes and receive the next set of tasks.
5.  **Repeat:** I will continue this cycle of executing, fixing, and validating until the pipeline reports that all issues have been resolved (`ALL_CLEAN`).

I will now begin this process, starting with the first set of critical fixes.
